I'm a PhD student at the School of [Philosophy, Psychology and Language Science](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls), at the University of Edinburgh (UK). I'm also an Early Stage Researcher in the [CoBra Network](https://www.cobra-network.eu), working on alignment with behavioural data. 

I study alignment in conversation, i.e. why and how people come to see the world in a similar way by talking to each other. In conversation, speakers come to understand each other by creating similar mental representations of what is discussed. Building similar representations of _ferries_, for example, often only requires speakers to have seen a ferry, have been on one or have read about one, but when it comes to abstract or contestable concepts (e.g., _freedom_, _justice_ or _utopia_), speakers' idiosyncratic background knowledge, past experience, and philosophical stances make building similar mental representations, and thus aligning and being able to discuss more difficult, along with our ability to explain them and to grab a general understanding of their mechanisms. 

I'm broadly interested in the interaction between social factors (e.g. speakers' social status) and alignment and the mechanisms that allow speakers to talk about _ferries_, as much as _freedom_, without a particular effort. I enjoy designing experiments that balance a controlled design and participants' freedom to interact (semi) spontaneously, observing how the conversation unfolds. 

I also enjoy data visualisation, as a tool to make scientific output democratic and understandable for different levels of expertise (I wrote a brief post about it [here](https://www.cobra-network.eu/2021/05/19/data-visualisation-what-should-we-learn-from-accessibility-and-data-journalism/)). I find the mapping between data shape, meaning and implications a stimulating challenge, which requires audience design and prospective taking (concepts which funnily enough related to my research topic).
