I'm a PhD student at the School of [Philosophy, Psychology and Language Science](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls), at the University of Edinburgh (UK). I'm also an Early Stage Researcher in the [CoBra Network](https://www.cobra-network.eu). I study alignment in conversation, that is why and how people come to see the world in a similar way by talking to each other. 

I'm interested in the social factors affecting alignment as well as its underlying mechanisms. How do we come to understand each others when we talk about _ferries_? and when we talk about _freedom_?
