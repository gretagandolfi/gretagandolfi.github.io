In July 2025, I started working as a Research Fellow at University College London, on the [ECOLANG project](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/brain-sciences/pals/research/experimental-psychology/research/language-and-cognition-lab/research/ecolang-corpus/about-ecolang). I'll add more details soon!

Before then, I obtained a PhD from the School of [Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls) at the University of Edinburgh. During my PhD, I was also an Early Stage Researcher in the [CoBra Network](https://www.cobra-network.eu), and I worked on alignment in human-human and human-machine interactions. 

I studied alignment in conversation, i.e. why and how people come to see the world in a similar way by talking to each other. In conversation, speakers come to understand each other by creating similar mental representations of what is discussed. Alignment often comes effortlessly, and yet its underlying mechanisms aren't trivial. Having similar representations of what a _ferry_ is, for example, may only require speakers to have seen a ferry, have been on one or have read about one. But when it comes to abstract or contestable concepts (e.g., _freedom_, _justice_ or _utopia_), speakers' idiosyncratic background knowledge, past experience and philosophical stances get in the way. 

I'm broadly interested in the interaction between contextual and social factors and alignment, and the mechanisms that allow speakers to talk about _ferries_, as much as _freedom_, still understanding each others. I enjoy designing experiments that balance a controlled design and participants' freedom to interact (semi) spontaneously, observing how the conversation unfolds. 

Some of my most recent interests include studying how information propagates in communities of speakers through interaction, how people learn from each other, and how they create new knowledge. In the future, I would like to apply cultural evolution techniques to study how speakers create and establish conventions, balancing imitation and creativity.

I also enjoy data visualisation, as a tool to make scientific output democratic and understandable for people with different levels of expertise (I wrote a brief post about it [here](https://www.cobra-network.eu/2021/05/19/data-visualisation-what-should-we-learn-from-accessibility-and-data-journalism/)). I find the mapping between data shape, meaning and implications a stimulating challenge, which requires audience design and prospective taking (concepts which funnily enough are very much related to my research topic).
